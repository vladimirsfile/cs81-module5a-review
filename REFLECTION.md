1. What did you learn from reading and commenting on this code?
 
By doing this assignment, I've understood a little bit more how the higher-order
functions work. How effectively you can process data within an array of objects. 


2. What was the most confusing part?
To me, the most challenging part was using the spread operator (...) and the 
"new Set" in the "uniqueHobbies" function.
